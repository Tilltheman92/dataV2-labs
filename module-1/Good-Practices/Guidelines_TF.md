Guidelines_TF

Guidelines for me to stick to while coding duiring the bootcamp.

LAYOUT:

- Use empty rows to seperate different parts of the code
- State all variables or given values in the begining
- Try to keep lines short for better overview

COMMENTS:

- Short/precise comments to outline what is done in the following code
- Located in the line above the segment it refers to
- Best to keep in 1 line
- Use for train of thought
- Use for accuring problems and lay down appoaches for solving to come back to later

NAMING:

- Use clear names indicating the actual variable/value
- try to avoid single letters
- try short word or abbrevations
