My first queries:1.What are the different genres?select prime_genrefrom appGroup by prime_genre;2. Which is the genre with the most apps rated?select prime_genre, rating_count_tot, COUNT(*) AS Ratingsfrom appGroup by prime_genre;Select prime_genre, SUM(rating_count_tot) AS RatingsFrom appGROUP By prime_genreORDER BY Ratings DESCLIMIT 1;3.

Give some insights.It gives out the most rated apps and thereby sort of the most poplar ones8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.It gives out 10 apps that are rated with 5 Stars, but there will be more apps, so it might be handy to also sort by the number of ratings and then show the top 10 to see the  apps with 5 Stars and most rated.9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?There is no overlaps and the results from Q5 are more helpful then from Q610. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?select track_name,user_rating,rating_count_totfrom appOrder by user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESCLIMIT 3;11. Do people care about the price of an app?ÊDo some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?select track_name,price,rating_count_tot,user_ratingfrom appOrder by rating_count_tot DESC, user_rating DESCLIMIT 50;This shows the most rated apps, with the highest user_rating. Only 6 of the top 50 cost more than 0Û. So people defietly care about the price
