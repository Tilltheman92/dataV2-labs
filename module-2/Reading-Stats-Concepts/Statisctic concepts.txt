Statisctic conceptsChallenge1:The mean is used in descriptive statistic it is defined as the ratio of observed values and number of values.Expected value of a random variable  is the value that the random variable will be on average.So the mean referees to a dataset and the expected value referees to a random variable.If we take a huge amount of tries the mean will get closer and closer to the expected value.Challenge2:The problem in science with p-values is, that they are misused and given to much attention or value.The p value in science indicates the probability of the real values in the population being at least as extreme as the ones in the test/experiment while assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It does NOT indicate the probability of the null hypothesis being true.It is used as the deciding factor on if a test or study is significant  etc. While it should just be one of many indicators with which you should analyse the results.It is also possible to manipulate the data to get to a smaller p which makes the overuse of p even more problematic.Challenge 3:Refering to the “What happened to Basecamp” article.The realization part of the article was pretty on point. So its important to hold all other variables constant in both groups except for the one you are looking at. So multivariate testing should not be done in this case
